Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\\nDiana: Thank you.

Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.\\nQuentin: I don\\'t know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.\\nTarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing? \\nQuentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm\\nTarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up. \\nQuentin: Great.\\nTarquin: How many books do you think there will be?\\nQuentin: About 200, like the other time.\\nTarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? \\nQuentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \\nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\\nTarquin: But it\\'s really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\\nQuentin: Yes, that\\'s probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\\nTarquin: Yes. That\\'s from Peter\\'s company right?\\nQuentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing. I\\'ll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise.',\n",

Only takes a day to be able to grout with the pre mix. You can do as many rows as you like also.\\nRoger: Right o. I just didn't know if they would shift around with more rows stacked on them?\\nDan: <file_photo> you just make a level ledger (2nd row). Mark a center line on all walls then see where the last tile is going to be on sides and ceilings. You do the bottom row closest to the shower pan last after the ledger row dries.\\nJim: Exactly, don't do the bottom row 1st, for some reason makes getting everything to line up pretty difficult. And push everything flat on the tile with a level so it looks good.\\nRoger: Okay, good to know. I was just going to start at the bottom and work my way up\\nDan: Might not work.

Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\\nDiana: Thank you. What's your current budget?\\nTom: We were thinking about £400 000. Would it be possible?\\nDiana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated?\\nTom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for.\\nDiana: How much are you aiming for?\\nTom: At least £300 000, it's in a very good condition, good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago.\\nDiana: Could you please send me some pictures?

They only tend to put fire under subjects such as immigration and other stigmatized and attacked groups, and not real problems. Nobody cares about the economy or human rights\\nPam: Yeah, I think there are more unconsious people nowadays because of tabloidisation of the whole media world. We read short-themed news, that are so well prepared to cause different type of strong emotions. \\nSam: Hm, I really see no solution to that. I am afraid, that the fake news industry is only set to gain meaning in the today’s world of internet. It would be really hard to prosecute for spreading falsehood, before it really gets a bigger meaning and recognition.\\nPam: Yes, it would be impossible. Under current circumstances less and less people read longer forms, such as books, reports or reportages. Everything has to be black or white, there is no such thing as a well driven polite debate about facts anymore. We only see insults, made up numbers and stats to prove an opinion. \\nSam: I could not have said it better… ',\n",

Tom: Actually there are two things. First of all my wife and I are looking for a flat. At the same time we want to sell our old flat. Diana: I understand. Thank you for contacting me I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent? Tom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest? Diana: It depends on what you value more it may sound obvious but if you value stability more than flexibility I would suggest you invest in buying a flat. Tom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future. Diana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget so you could save for later. Tom: Thank you! This is a great advice! Tom: I will talk to my wife but for now I think we could focus on buying something similar size. Diana: How many rooms are you looking for? Tom: Two bedrooms at least joined kitchen and living room is fine as well. Diana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood? Tom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable. Diana: Thank you. What's your current budget? Tom: We were thinking about 400 000. Would it be possible? Diana: I think so. Would you accept a flat that needs to be renovated? Tom: It depends on how much we can sell our flat for. Diana: How much are you aiming for? Tom: At least 300 000 it's in a very good condition good neighbourhood and it has been renovated only a year ago. Diana: Could you please send me some pictures? I would also gladly make an appointment with you. Tom: That would be perfect! Diana: Would Monday at 8 be acceptable? Tom: Hm I need to consult it with my wife but so far it's all right.\",\n",

It involved a penguin which as you know can be a very offensive topic. Quentin: I don't know. People today as so sensitive but are ignorant anyway. Tarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing?  Quentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm Tarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up.  Quentin: Great. Tarquin: How many books do you think there will be? Quentin: About 200 like the other time. Tarquin: how many did you sell on the spot?  Quentin: Only 30 the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out. Tarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige.  Quentin: Naturally. Top sort that Helen. Tarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time? Quentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each. Tarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying? Quentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face. Tarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark because of the social evening. Quentin: Yes that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine I might add. Tarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right? Quentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special Quentin price only on the evening of the unboxing. I'll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise.\",\n",
