18 label         : The original location of the La Cobata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination. Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base. Rock was not removed from around the earspools as on other heads and does not narrow towards the base. Large parts of the monument seem to be roughed out without finished detail. The right hand earspool also appears incomplete the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished. The La Cobata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne.

26 label         : Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus Attalea broadly defined. In 1965 Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman s lead Rafal Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result what Henderson interpreted as variation within species Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect.

27 label         : The five reel film was released through the Path Exchange as a Path Gold Rooster Play on October 7 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor s Trade Review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness which should prove a strong program for the Path program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film s excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable but found Warde s performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.

Agrippina also attempted to influence the young Nero. Agrippina also is mentioned by ancient sources as scheming for her son Nero. This scheming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them. It is extremely unusual to see a women s face on a coin in the ancient world. It is because of this position of power Agrippina felt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in Nero s court as he offered the advice Nero wanted to hear unlike his mother.

This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously see damnatio memoriae. Champlin however doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death.

37 label         : According to Stevens in one of his first games as head coach he was nervous and felt like our team played on edge because of it. He decided that a team s play will reflect the mood of its coach a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. I don t want to lose a game because of my approach he told himself. Accordingly he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes preferring to focus on the next play rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler s 2010 Final Four run by saying When those big runs by Syracuse and Kansas State came Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us he loves us and we re going to win the game. On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player he does it with positive reinforcement just at a little louder decibel according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all Stevens wants his players to be confident not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.

46 label         : Like the other poems making up the Four Quartets Little Gidding deals with the past present and future and humanity s place within them as each generation is seemingly united. In the second section there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets including Dante Swift Yeats and others. When the ghost joins the poet the narrator states Knowing myself yet being someone other. This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge allowing a communication and connection with the dead. Later in the fourth section humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London redemption or destruction. God s love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the living hell through purgation by fire. The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet. He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society.

In many instances existing portraits of Domitian such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva. This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material. In addition the vast palace which Domitian had erected on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace was renamed the House of the People and Nerva himself took up residence in Vespasian s former villa in the Gardens of Sallust.

62 label         : Mendes spent more time recutting the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together. He trialled several versions of the opening the first edit included bookend scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester s murder but Mendes excised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production. Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film into an episode of NYPD Blue. Instead he wanted the ending to be a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution. When Ball first saw a completed edit it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes. He felt that they were so short that they didn t really register. Mendes and he argued but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely Ball felt that without the scenes the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that for all its darkness had a really romantic heart.

65 label         : According to Cassius Dio the conspirators approached Nerva as a potential successor prior to the assassination which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva s direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate within hours after the news of the assassination broke.

73 label         : Sylvester detects the influence of late works by Titian in other aspects especially in the deep and rich colouring Velzquez s portrayals of Philip IV and agrees with identification of pastels of Edgar Degas as a source. He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what Degas described as shuttering as seen in the earlier artist s After the Bath Woman drying herself. Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian s Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto. He believes the folds serve to push the viewer back creating a distance from the subject an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison. Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter. In his Interviews with Francis Bacon series of books he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant. The artist replied Well it means that the sensation doesn t come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps.

79 label         : Professor Roy M. Anker argues that the film s thematic center is its direction to the audience to look closer. The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams neighborhood with Lester s narrated admission that he will soon die forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries Anker asks from what place exactly and from what state of being is he telling this story? If he s already dead why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died or will die. Anker believes the preceding scene Jane s discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery the film allows the audience to put it aside to view the film and its philosophical issues. Through this examination of Lester s life rebirth and death American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester s transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela he therefore remains a willing devotee of the popular media s exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness. Carolyn is similarly driven

91 label         : The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure s voice is unable to escape as if it is screaming in silence. Rueful later in life Bacon said that he had wanted to paint the scream more than the horror. I think if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream it would have made the scream... more successful. The work evokes memories of the Second World War. The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court when he was held within a similar cage. Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though and stated that he used the device so he could frame and really see the image for no other reason. I know it s been interpreted as being many other things. Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity. Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian shouting voices... and trembling hands... convey ing the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation.

108 label         : The shooting script features a scene in Angela s car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty the scene differed from earlier versions which set it as a big scene on a freeway in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash but only half a day was available. Ball agreed but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky s where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman When you see something like that it s like God is looking right at you just for a second. And if you re careful you can look right back. Jane asks And what do you see? Ricky Beauty. Ball said They wanted to cut that scene. They said it s not important. I said You re out of your fucking mind. It s one of the most important scenes in the movie... If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie that is the line. Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence set in a schoolyard it presents a turning point for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela.

Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull. Trematosaurs include a diversity of temnospondyls including large marine trematosauroids aquatic plagiosaurs brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceous and metoposauroids with eyes near the front of their heads. In 2000 paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls the Rhytidostea. This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria and included groups like Lydekkerinidae Rhytidosteidae and Brachyopoidea. While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses. Rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospond

Even before the arrival of Mortier s courier he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column Dokhturov s was descending from the mountains to take the road to Drenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault heralded by cannon fire caused Dokhturov s troops to turn their attention from Gazan s beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers Dokhturov s column had no supporting artillery and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov s turn to face attackers at his front and rear until the arrival of Schmitt s column which had wended its way through the mountains in the west.

It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing Yongsan where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces supply lines and threatening other divisions rear areas. However once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air armor and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8 the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed.

167 label         : The revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle and if it had been combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.

182 label         : Turan cited Ball s lack of constraint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness in particular the script s subtle changes in tone. McCarthy said the script was as fresh and distinctive as any of its American film contemporaries and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball s dialogue tart and said the characters Carolyn excepted were deeply drawn. One other flaw McCarthy said was the revelation of Col. Fitts homosexuality which he said evoked hoary Freudianism. Jackson said the film transcended its clichd setup to become a wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy. He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs it did so with unexpected nuance. Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester s murder believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense. McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses and said the soundtrack was good at creating ironic counterpoint s to the story. Hentzi concluded that American Beauty was vital but uneven he felt the film s examination of the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other s lives was its best point and that although Lester and Angela s dynamic was familiar its romantic irony stood beside the most enduring literary treatments of the theme such as Lolita.

By confronting the issue and Carolyn s superficial investments in others Lester is trying to regain a voice in a home that only respects the voices of mother and daughter. His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex after she confesses her virginity he no longer thinks of her as a sex object but as a daughter. He holds her close and wraps her up. Mendes called it the most satisfying end to Lester s journey there could possibly have been. With these final scenes Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a mythical quest. After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator the camera pushes toward him then stops facing a hallway down which he walks to meet his fate. Having begun to act his age again Lester achieves closure.

209 label         : Most critics focused on Heads I and VI remarking favourably on the progression between the two. While some found the inherent violence of the paintings distasteful Brausen was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety and brought Bacon s work to national attention. Peppiatt notes that the exhibition showed Bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought by presenting his sitter in a vestigial setting a cage or behind a parted curtin... the rest the most essential lay in the manipulation of the infinitely suggestive medium of oil paint. After the showing Bacon gradually became less the outsider with an occasional image of horrifying brilliance and more a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary scene.

Since the previous afternoon North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter. Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed. Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself. Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole. Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units. Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came. Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it. Six times Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it. In this close action Ouellette was killed. Most of the foxholes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire. One of these killed Schmitt on September 3.

266 label         : Kershaw s pitching style relies on deception. He keeps the ball hidden so that it is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches. Out of the windup Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a kickstand move drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle. Out of the stretch he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up Roger Clemens.

Clearly linking Objectivism s principles with Imagism s Louis Zukofsky insisted in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry on writing which is the detail not mirage of seeing of thinking with the things as they exist and of directing them along a line of melody. Zukofsky was a major influence on the Language poets who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development.

The subsequent Peace of Pressburg signed on 26 December 1805 reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and Lunville. Furthermore Austria ceded land to Napoleon s German allies and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia Russia and Austria. These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 in which Austria did not participate.

285 label         : Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s. In about 1991 92 Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for 10 minutes saying later that it provoked an unexpected emotional response. In 1992 Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he felt like there was a real story underneath that was more fascinating and way more tragic than the story presented to the public and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes and because each character s story was.. intensely personal it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version but Carolyn did not feature strongly Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.

286 label         : The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 the model was tested as a possible light cruiser since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor the Mark VI. The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance. Despite this it was decided that it was essential for some Tetrarchs to be produced and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program. Accordingly the War Office gave the Tetrarch the official General Staff specification number A17 and in November 1938 accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank s range.

Within Christian communities these writings along with others fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist. In 310 Lactantius wrote that Nero suddenly disappeared and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that having been conveyed to a distant region he is still reserved alive and to him they apply the Sibylline verses Lactantius maintains that it is not right to believe this.

John of Salisbury who was a secretary for Theobald added information about Osbert in a letter to Alexander III on unrelated business. In the section of the letter John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about Osbert he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent. Another contemporary Gilbert Foliot who was Bishop of Hereford wrote to the pope to remind him that although Osbert s accuser had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal.

A few days after the beginning of the operation the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support.

The timing of the respite varies depending on whose reports are consulted fighting paused at around 12 00 or 14 00.

Caught between two strong forces Gazan attempted to push his way back through Drenstein to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik s Russians appeared to block their retreat.

305 label         : The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies CIMSS at the University of Wisconsin Madison has developed the Objective Dvorak Technique ODT. This is a modified version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than subjective human interpretation to arrive at a CI number. This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms. The China Meteorological Agency CMA is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future. The Indian Meteorological Department IMD prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum.

313 label         : Oxaziridines have been found to undergo rearrangement reactions via a radical mechanism when irradiated with UV light or in the presence of a single electron transfer reagent such as CuI. spirocylic oxaziridines undergo ring expansions to the corresponding lactam. Interestingly the migrating substituent is determined by a stereoelectronic effect where the group trans to the lone pair on the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product. In light of this effect it is possible to take advantage of the chiral nitrogen due to high inversion barrier to direct the rearrangement. This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed selectivities in the rearrangements below. In the rearrangement on the left the thermodynamically unfavorable product is observed exclusively while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored.

319 label         : While the swift transfer of power following Domitian s death had prevented a civil war from erupting Nerva s position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession he had ordered a halt to treason trials but at the same time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to chaos as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies leading the consul Fronto to famously remark that Domitian s tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva s anarchy. Early in 97 a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed but once again Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death much to the disapproval of the Senate.

Tacitus in book XIII of his Annals describes Nero as being scarcely out of his boyhood at the time he became emperor. Ancient historians describe Nero s early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca and the Praetorian Prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus especially in the first year.

325 label         : One group of temnospondyls the Branchiosauridae is also known from larval specimens. Branchiosaurids like Branchiosaurus and Apateon are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills. An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens but the lack of terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neotenic. Unlike other temnospondyls their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature. Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles. Recently large specimens of Apateon gracilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic.

El Amor was motivated by Arjona s desire to examine those big dark events within love that nobody talks about he continued the dark sides of love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value. Arjona added So many good things abould love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones. In a February 2012 interview Arjona stated that El Amor was the most tawdry song he had released to date explaining that their choice of the song was a contradiction because it was not the song which could better represent the entire album. He described it as very strong and a bit dark.

368 label         : According to Patti Bellantoni colors are used symbolically throughout the film none more so than red which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and defines Lester s arc. First seen in drab colors that reflect his passivity Lester surrounds himself with red as he regains his individuality. The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol when Lester fantasizes about Angela she is usually naked and surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes the rose symbolizes Lester s desire for her. When associated with Carolyn the rose represents a faade for suburban success. Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnhams home where they signify a mask covering a bleak unbeautiful reality. Carolyn feels that as long as there can be roses all is well. She cuts the roses and puts them in vases where they adorn her meretricious vision of what makes for beauty and begin to die. The roses in the vase in the Angela Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester s previous life and Carolyn the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer finally taking the roses and thus Carolyn out of the shot. Lester s epiphany at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester

369 label         : Recently the theory that temnospondyls were the ancestors of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls has been compared to those of modern frogs and salamanders but the presence of bicuspid pedicellate teeth in small paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. Calcification resumes at the base leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils.

373 label         : The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing. Instead these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound.

375 label         : Unlike modern amphibians many temnospondyls are covered in small closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls are covered in rows of large ventral plates. During early stages of development they first have only small rounded scales. Fossils show as the animals grew the scales on the undersides of their bodies developed into large wide ventral plates. The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility. Later semiaquatic temnospondyls such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs have no evidence of scales. They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration the absorption of oxygen through the skin.

381 label         : Homologues of most of the bones of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods aside from a few bones in the skull such as interfrontals internasals and interparietals that have developed in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by indentations called otic notches in some temnospondyls such as Zatrachys they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes choanae are present in front of these vacuities and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls such as Nigerpeton tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.

418 label         : I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.

463 label         : During the 16th century Bintulu was named River de Burulu by Portuguese cartographers. There are several legends surrounding the name Bintulu. During the Brooke dynasty the indigenous Iban people practised headhunting to maintain their social status in the community. They threw the heads into the Kemena River after which the heads had to be collected from the river. The practice of collecting the heads was known as Mentu Ulau picking heads in the local native language. Another story relates that two Iban warriors named Bernik and Jelab built houses along the river. They and their followers frequently carried out preservation of severed heads near a small river stream branching off from Sebezaw River because the river bank was flat and wide. Therefore the small river stream was named Mentu Ulau river. Outsiders who came to Bintulu subsequently pronounced the name as Mentulau and later the name evolved into Bentulu and finally Bintulu.

Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals have been found in these pouches. The living Darwin s Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.

Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.

479 label         : A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu s work into English. As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu which is why we need as many different translations as possible p. xxii. The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear particularly when translating regulated verse or lshi and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works Hawkes writes that his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation p. ix. One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth s One Hundred Poems From the Chinese. His are free translations which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection and secondly to translate out the references in those works which he does select.

In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway. Gore used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his Waltham estate where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in 1799. After his return to London with the commission work still stopped he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe. They visited Holland Belgium and Switzerland and spent six months in Paris. During this trip and later ones in England and Scotland they took note of the architecture of country estates and began planning a new house for their Waltham property.

The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions Moffat said that I think he s probably reached the point in his life where he s saying Friendship for me is just postponed bereavement I want to be on my own for a while. Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor William Hartnell in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s but rejected by the production team at the time.

485 label         : Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of American Beauty film critics are similarly divided not so much about the quality of the film as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about the meaning of life or the hollow existence of the American suburbs the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it a mystery story a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia a series of love stories... it was about imprisonment... loneliness and beauty. It was funny it was angry sad. The literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation American Beauty cannot be adequately summarized as here is a satire on what s wrong with American life that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror and Ball s disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky s philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live. He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center a controlling voice who unites all of the choices. He contends that in

Its size limited the possible crew to three a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander in addition to his own duties had to act as loader for the 2 pounder which caused delays in combat.

The Snowmen is the debut of a redesigned TARDIS interior as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune. The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor s face the first time since Survival the final serial of the classic series in 1989 that the Doctor s face has been seen in the title sequence. Moffat had noticed that the TARDIS design was getting progressively whimsical and resembled more of a magical place rather than a machine. It was designed by series production designer Michael Pickwood who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be darker and moodier and provide an easier access to the gallery of the ship when shooting.

Roger Ebert echoing earlier praise for the performances direction and cinematography and adding laurels for editor Dede Allen cites the film as one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories. He further cites Fast Eddie Felson as one of only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touchstones. TV Guide calls the film a dark stunner offering a grim world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table yet with characters who maintain a shabby nobility and grace. The four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as not to be missed.

This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the aqueducts. The latter program was headed by the former consul Sextus Julius Frontinus who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on Rome s water supply De Aquis Urbis Romae. The only major landmarks constructed under Nerva were a granary known as the Horrea Nervae and a small Imperial Forum begun by Domitian which linked the Forum of Augustus to the Temple of Peace.

557 label         : Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small regularly spaced pits are the first to form followed by larger ridges. As development continues the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull with ossification the replacement of cartilage by bone happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.

559 label         : Bacon s output is characterised by sequences of images. He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that images breed other images in me. His series were not always planned or painted in sequence sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone. The idea for the head series came after he returned penniless late in 1948 from a stay in Tangier. In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting 1946. Although he continued to paint he was a ruthless self critic given to slashing canvases with blades and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948. Gallerist Erica Brausen offered Bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery. He agreed but had nothing in reserve to hang. In following years Brausen became perhaps the most important of Bacon s early champions she arranged this showing his debut solo exhibition publicised him widely and organised viewings for international buyers.

562 label         : All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars volcanic mudslides that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head 1 and Nestepe Colossal Head 1 also known as Tres Zapotes Monuments A and Q came from the same hill.

583 label         : The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated. However the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium. Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years. The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest and are the most skillfully executed. All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology generally to the Early Preclassic 1500 1000 BC although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic 1000 400 BC.

Furthermore he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against Domitian.

598 label         : Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work a practice which Burton Watson attributes to the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality. Since many of Du Fu s poems feature morality and history this practice is particularly important. Another reason identified by the Chinese historian William Hung is that Chinese poems are typically concise omitting context that might be relevant but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers The less accurately we know the time the place and the circumstances in the background the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether. Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu arguing that the variety of the poet s work required consideration of his whole life rather than the reductive categorizations used for more limited poets.

613 label         : For the French the survival of the Corps Mortier seemed nothing short of a miracle. The remainder of Gazan s division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated in Vienna which the French acquired by deception later in the month. More importantly for them the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions. Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft. They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krems overturning their boats. Tossed into the icy river most had drowned. Despite this initial panic Gazan s column retained its cohesion and responded well to various difficult demands. Dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen when he heard cannon fire he directed his troops toward it to support the French division. In terms of French staffing Mortier s failure to guard his flank especially in the face of Napoleon s direct advice adversely influenced his relationship with his commander. However in the immediate weeks ahead the flamboyant Murat did more to annoy Napoleon than Mortier had. In assessing the battle and its aftermath historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mortier and Gazan Napoleon aware of Mortier s

Owen s Labyrinthodon Jaegeri was later found at Guy s Cliffe England by paleontologist William Buckland. Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of Warwickshire. As more fossils were uncovered in England Owen depicted these labyrinthodonts as the highest form of batrachian and compared them to crocodiles which he considered the highest form of reptiles. He also noted the large labyrinthodonts of the Keuper a unit of rocks that dates to the Late Triassic were younger than more advanced reptiles in the Magnesian and Zechstein which are Late Permian in age. Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequential progression from early amphibians what he called metamorphosed fishes.

These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses they have squat wide proportions and distinctive facial features. The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site. The discovery of one of the Tres Zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.

637 label         : Originally temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae. Early forms with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements were placed in the suborder Rachitomi and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli. With the recent growth of phylogenetics this classification is no longer viable. The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls. Moreover the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear. Some temnospondyls have rhachitomous semirhachitomous and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column. Other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category. Rachitomi is no longer recognized as a group but Stereospondyli is still considered valid. Below is a simplified taxonomy of temnospondyls showing currently recognized groups

Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.

656 label         : A new phylogeny of temnospondyls was offered by paleontologist Rainer Schoch in 2013. It supported many of the clades that were found by Yates and Warren but it did not find support for their division of derived stereospondyls into Euskelia and Limnarchia. Eryopids were found to be more closely related to stereospondyls than to dissorophoids which were grouped with dvinosaurs. The clade including Eryopidae and Stereospondylomorpha was named Eryopiformes. In addition Schoch named the clade containing all temnospondyls except edopoids Eutemnospondyli and reinstated the name Rhachitomi for the clade containing all temnospondyls except edopoids and dendrerpetontids.

When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22 00 McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins still alive in his paralyzed condition refused efforts of evacuation saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions.

671 label         : Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz describe mixed emotions about the religiosity of the poem. Cowley emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages. Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding. F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem costs Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets. E. M. Forster did not like Eliot s emphasis on pain and responded to the poem Of course there s pain on and off through each individual s life... You can t shirk it and so on. But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer. Writing in 2003 Roger Scruton wrote that in Little Gidding Eliot achieved that for which he envies Dante namely a poetry of belief in which belief and words are one and in which the thought cannot be prized

689 label         : By the end of the 19th century most of what are today regarded as temnospondyls were placed in the suborder Labyrinthodonta. American paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case called it Labyrinthodonta vera or true labyrinthodonts. The names Stegocephalia and Labyrinthodontia were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged. The labyrinthodontian suborders Microsauria and Branchiosauria both of which contain temnospondyls were distinct from Labyrinthodonta. Within Labyrinthodonta were the groups Rhachitomi Labyrinthodonti and Embolerimi. Members of Rhachitomi such as Archegosaurus and Eryops had rhachitomous vertebrae with enlarged intercentra that displaced the pleurocentra. Labyrinthodonti such as Mastodonsaurus Trematosaurus and Micropholis had lost their pleurocentra and the intercentra made up the entire body of the vertebrae. Embolerimi had intercentra and pleurocentra that were of equal size. Embolomeres are now identified as reptiliomorphs distantly related to temnospondyls.

701 label         : Osbert de Bayeux floruit 1121 to 1184 was a medieval English cleric and archdeacon in the Diocese of York. A relative of Thurstan the Archbishop of York Osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative. After Thurstan s death Osbert was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric William fitzHerbert and worked to secure fitzHerbert s deposition and replacement by Henry Murdac. After Murdac s death in 1153 Osbert tried to prevent the return of fitzHerbert but these attempts were unsuccessful. When fitzHerbert died suddenly in 1154 Osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop. Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court he was stripped of his clerical status and became a layman before 1158. He died after 1184 perhaps even after 1194.

706 label         : Steel was also an obvious material for armor. It was tested in the 1860s but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells. Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates giving a form of compound armor. This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s first for turret armor starting with HMS Inflexible and then for all armor starting with HMS Colossus of 1882. The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately with licenses being given for the use of the Wilson System of producing fused armor.

In that year he took the civil service exam likely in Chang an. He failed to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure he went back to traveling this time around Shandong and Hebei.

717 label         : Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. I think it s a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players he explains. For example when Butler was slumping in late 2010 Stevens challenged his team this 46 defensive field goal percentage is where we are. This isn t acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It s not just get better defensively it is if we give up 3 less baskets a game then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country. The team got the message improved throughout the season and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012 Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.

721 label         : The events of August 1969 in Derry and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the traditionalists and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Initially both armies organised for defensive purposes only although the Provisionals were planning towards an offensive campaign. In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and householders commonly paid subscriptions to both. When rioters were arrested after the Official s Easter parade in March 1970 Officials and Provisionals picketed their trial together. At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members. Martin McGuinness who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades initially joined the Officials but a few months later left to join the Provisionals.

Two major clades were Euskelia and Limnarchia. Euskelia includes the temnospondyls that were once called rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies the Dissorophoidea and the Eryopoidea. Dissorophoids include small mostly terrestrial temnospondyls that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians. Eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like Eryops. The second major clade Limnarchia includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls as well as some Permian groups. Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls the stereospondyls.

730 label         : Accusations of treason being plotted against Nero and the Senate first appeared in 62. The Senate ruled that Antistius a praetor should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party. Later Nero ordered the exile of Fabricius Veiento who slandered the Senate in a book. Tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by Gaius Calpurnius Piso began in this year. To consolidate power Nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas Rubellius Plautus and Faustus Sulla. According to Suetonius Nero showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death whomsoever he pleased during this period.

731 label         : Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder which expanded rapidly after combustion this meant cannons had relatively short barrels to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets allowing a slower more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.

Tracking westward intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17. Upon moving into the South China Sea conditions allowed for quicker strengthening and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph making it a severe tropical storm. However atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21 weakening the system. The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi Vietnam the following day. Tracking inland the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July 23.

They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture. In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of Olmec writing with the earliest examples of Olmec hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC. Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts the texts are short and have been partially deciphered based on their similarity to other Mesoamerican scripts. The evidence of complex society developing in the Olmec heartland has led to the Olmecs being regarded as the Mother Culture of Mesoamerica although this concept remains controversial.

740 label         : The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August one of which became Tropical Depression Lakay near the Philippines. On August 18 an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon. It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction. On August 19 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vamco to the east of Taiwan. Later that day the circulation passed just 55 km 35 mi north of Taipei although the convection was exposed that time. On August 20 the JMA assessed Vamco as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China.

743 label         : The most basal group of temnospondyls is the superfamily Edopoidea. Edopoids have several primitive or plesiomorphic features including a single occipital condyle and a bone called the intertemporal that is absent in other temnospondyls. Edopoids include the Late Carboniferous genus Edops and the family Cochleosauridae. Dendrerpetontidae has also been included in Edopoidea and is the oldest known temnospondyl family. Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species having been present over 330 million years ago during the Visan stage of the Early Carboniferous. Recent analyses place Dendrerpetontidae outside Edopoidea in a more derived position. Other primitive temnospondyls include Capetus and Iberospondylus. Saharastega and Nigerpeton both described in 2005 from Niger are also primitive yet come from the Late Permian. They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal temnospondyls implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record.

744 label         : Relations between the British Army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969. In September after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man William King the British Army erected a peace ring to enclose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled. Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets. Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary there was anger among young people. Clashes between youths and troops became more frequent. The riot following the Officials Easter parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used snatch squads who rushed into the Bogside wielding batons to make arrests. The snatch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations. There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random sometimes days after the alleged offence and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance. The rioters were condemned as hooligans by moderates who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation. The Labour radicals and Official republicans still working together tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations one such organization was named the Young Hooligans Association but to no avail

772 label         : Like other American films of 1999 such as Fight Club Bringing Out the Dead and Magnolia American Beauty instructs its audience to lead more meaningful lives. The film argues the case against conformity but does not deny that people need and want it even the gay characters just want to fit in. Jim and Jim the Burnhams other neighbors are a satire of gay bourgeois coupledom who invest in the numbing sameness that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples. The feminist academic and author Sally R. Munt argues that American Beauty uses its art house trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes and that this approach is a clich of bourgeois preoccupation... the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual self through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel.

Marianne Moore who was at most a fringe member of the group carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with compression of language. William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken from the mouths of Polish mothers. Both Pound and H.D. turned to writing long poems but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an Imagist legacy. Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of Imagism.

790 label         : Thomas Newman s score was recorded in Santa Monica California. He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes. Newman favored pulse rhythm and color over melody making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created. He built each cue around small endlessly repeating phrases often the only variety through a thinning of the texture for eight bars. The percussion instruments included tablas bongos cymbals piano xylophones and marimbas also featured were guitars flute and world music instruments. Newman also used electronic music and on quirkier tracks employed more unorthodox methods such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a detuned mandolin. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the moral ambiguity of the script It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that.

795 label         : In 1997 Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and Cybill. He joined the United Talent Agency where his representative Andrew Cannava suggested he write a spec script to reintroduce himself to the town as a screenwriter. Ball pitched three ideas to Cannava two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s. Despite the story s lack of an easily marketable concept Cannava selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion. While developing the script Ball created another television sitcom Oh Grow Up. He channeled his anger and frustration at having to accede to network demands on that show and during his tenures on Grace Under Fire and Cybill into writing American Beauty.
